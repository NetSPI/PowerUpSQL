### PowerUpSQL: A PowerShell Toolkit for Attacking SQL Server

PowerUpSQL includes functions that support SQL Server discovery, weak configuration auditing, privilege escalation on scale, and post exploitation actions such as OS command execution. It is intended to be used during internal penetration tests and red team engagements. However, PowerUpSQL also includes many functions that can be used by administrators to quickly inventory the SQL Servers in their ADS domain and perform common threat hunting tasks related to SQL Server.

### Issue Reports

I perform QA on functions before we publish them, but it's hard to consider every scenario. So I just wanted to say thanks to those of you that have taken the time to give me a heads up on issues with PowerUpSQL so that we can make it better. :)
